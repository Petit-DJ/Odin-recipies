    <h3><b>Description</b></h3>
    <p>
        Freddo espresso, meaning cold espresso, is leisurely sipped in Greece by locals and tourists alike. And it’s easy to make at home–Ideally with an espresso machine, but you can make this with an espresso pod or even drip coffee if you’d like!
        Whenever I arrive at the Greek International Terminal, I first order a slice of Spanakopita and a Freddo Espresso–my first coffee fix once landing in Greece after a long flight. Off I go, caffeine-pumped and ready to hit the Athenian roads. 
        For those who can’t get to Greece, there is no need to miss out; you can make this coffee in the comfort of your home. Simply shake a double shot of espresso in a cocktail shaker or jar until it’s cold and foamy, then serve over ice with, if you prefer, a dash of milk.
